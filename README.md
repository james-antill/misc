 Random scripts that don't have a home elsewhere.

 * jenk.py - Jenkins command line client, does simple status stuff all the way upto full html reports on pagure pull requests.
 * rpmps-errata.py - Errata queries that can be done on a simple representation of a system/container/whatever. Fedora only atm as it uses bodhi for the errata data, with caching. rpm data is got via. running a shell script for rpm/coreutils on the image. Fedmsg was tried, but didn't work well.
 * koji-profiles.py - List koji profiles.
