 Random scripts that don't have a home elsewhere.

 * jenk.py - Jenkins command line client, does simple status stuff all the way upto full html reports on pagure pull requests.
 * rpmps-errata.py - Errata queries that can be done on a simple representation of a system/container/whatever. Fedora only atm.
